                Suppose I had a time-machine. And I used it to go back in time, say 200 BC, and tried to buy a bag of rice using a 100-dollar bill. I’d probably get killed.
               </p>
            
               <p>
                But the same 100-dollar bill, in the 21st century, can get me a whole lot of things.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                <b>So what’s the difference?</b>
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                In 200 BC, the 100-dollar bill is nothing but a colorful piece of paper. You can’t eat it, plant it, or make weapons from it. 
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                Whereas in the 21st century, that colorful piece of paper holds a value in everyone’s shared-imagination. Although I can’t eat it, plant it, or make weapons from it, I can exchange it for something else. And why would the other person be willing to accept that 100-dollar bill? Because he believes that someone else will be willing to accept it for something else.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                    I found this really fascinating that all of our daily transactions, in fact the whole world’s economy, is based on trust with each other— on the concept that one is willing to exchange goods for money because someone else would also be willing to accept that money in exchange for something else.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>  
                <b>What happens when the trust is lost?</b>
               </p>

                The above is a real 100 TRILLION dollar issued by the government of Zimbabwe. A result of printing unlimited money which destroyed the country’s whole economy. A result of violating the trust.
