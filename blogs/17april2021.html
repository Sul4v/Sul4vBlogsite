                    Success is a function of a lot of variables, and one of them is luck. If you do the right thing with the right person at the right time, boom! You’re in luck baby! But if you do the right thing with the right person at the wrong time, crash! Hasta la vista, baby!

                    I recently came across with a chapter in a book that I’m reading which talks about how “lucky” was Bill Gates. If he was born in another city or had gone to another school, odds are, he wouldn’t have become the “Bill Gates” that he is today.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The below paragraphs (from the book The Psychology Of Money) explains it all:
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="other-text">
                    <p>
                        Bill Gates went to one of the only high schools in the world that had a computer.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Most university graduate schools did not have a computer anywhere near as advanced as Bill Gates had access to in eighth grade. And he couldn’t get enough of it.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Gates was 13 years old in 1968 when he met classmate Paul Allen. Allen was also obsessed with the school’s computer, and the two hit it off.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Lakeside’s computer wasn’t part of its general curriculum. It was an independent study program. Bill and Paul could toy away with the thing at their leisure, letting their creativity run wild─after school, late into the night, on weekends. They quickly became computing experts.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        During one of their late-night sessions, Allen recalled Gates showing him a Fortune magazine and saying, “What do you think it’s like to run a Fortune 500 company?” Allen said he had no idea. “Maybe we’ll have our own computer company someday,” Gates said. Microsoft is now worth more than a trillion dollars.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        A little quick math.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In 1968, there were roughly 303 million high-school-age people in the world, according to the UN.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        About 18 million of them lived in the United States.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        About 270,000 of them lived in Washington state.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        A little over 100,000 of them lived in the Seattle area.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        And only about 300 of them attended Lakeside School.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Start with 303 million, end with 300.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        One in a million high-school-age students attended the high school that had the combination of cash and foresight to buy a computer. Bill Gates happened to be one of them.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Gates is not shy about what this meant. “If there had been no Lakeside, there would have been no Microsoft,” he told the school’s graduating class in 2005.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Of course I’m not saying that hard work doesn’t pay off. It does pay off. But for it to immensely pay off, you also need a fair amount of luck with you.<br> Don’t you think among the 303 million high-school-age students there were others who were just as smart as, if not more than, Bill Gates? Don’t you think others were also just as hardworking as Bill Gates was?
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Now don’t get me wrong here. I don’t mean talent and hard work is nothing. But to someone who says that “Luck is nothing but an excuse,” think about that.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So how can we measure our luck?: We can’t. <br>
                    But yea, Lady luck favors the one who tries right?
                    Someone who puts in the effort will always have a higher chance of succeeding than, say, a couch-potato.
