                <p>A few weeks ago, I was at a restaurant, having some ME-time. Arjit Singh was singing in the background as I was sipping hot Americano from my cup. The atmosphere was pleasant.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    All of a sudden, a 4-year-old boy started running around from table to table, making loud noises. The parents were sitting at a corner table, smiling— a sign of approval for the kid. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone in the restaurant looked at the kid with complete disgrace in their eyes.
                </p>
               <br>
                <p>
                    I asked myself, “What would I have done if I had a kid, and he/she misbehaved? Would I stay silent or punish her?”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Either of my actions would have a psychological effect on my kid. So, I couldn't answer those questions. 
                </p>

                    I was reading one book recently and I came across a chapter, “Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.” And I think my questions are answered.
	                <br>Here are a few paragraphs from the chapter:
                </p>
                <br>

                        Take the case of the three-year-old who has not learned to share. She displays her selfish behaviour in the presence of her parents, but they’re too nice to intervene. More truthfully, they refuse to pay attention, admit to what is happening, and teach her how to act properly. They’re annoyed, of course, when she won’t share with her sister, but they pretend everything is OK. It’s not OK. They’ll snap at her later, for something totally unrelated. She will be hurt by that, and confused, but learn nothing. Worse: when she tries to make friends, it won’t go well, because of her lack of social sophistication. Children her own age will be put off by her inability to cooperate. They’ll fight with her, or wander off and find someone else to play with. The parents of those children will observe her awkwardness and misbehaviour, and won’t invite her back to play with their kids. She will be lonely and rejected. That will produce anxiety, depression and resentment. That will produce the turning from life that is equivalent to the wish for unconsciousness.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Parents who refuse to adopt the responsibility for disciplining their children turn that responsibility over to the harsh, uncaring judgemental world.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        . . .
                    </p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        You love your kids, after all. If their actions make you dislike them, think what an effect they will have on other people, who care much less about them than you. Those other people will punish them, severely, by omission or commission. Don’t allow that to happen. Better to let your little monsters know what is desirable and what is not, so they become sophisticated denizens of the world outside the family.
                    </p>

                    Of course, I’m just scratching the surface here. If you found this interesting, you’ll probably love the book “12 Rules for Life” by Canadian clinical psychologist and psychology professor <b>Jordan Peterson.</b>
