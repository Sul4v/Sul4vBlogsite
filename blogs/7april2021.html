                I turned from a Meh to a Diehard fan of Barcelona, thanks to Instagram (Facebook).
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                Before talking about that, let's have a basic understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Facebook.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                <strong>AI</strong>
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                A human child learns and grows from mistakes. Similarly, a programmer feeds the AI with billions and trillions of bytes of data from which the AI learns and evolves (at an astonishingly high speed).
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                “If this happens, do this in return.” This is what AI is at its fundamental.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                   <strong>Facebook</strong>
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                Facebook is a social media platform which we users basically use for free.	
               </p>
               <p>
                Ever wondered how Facebook makes money?
               </p>
               <p>
                Advertisements. The more they show ads to their users, the more they earn.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                   <i><b>This is where Facebook and the AI shake their hands.</b></i>
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                “If we show more ads to our users, the more money we make,” Facebook thought. “And for that, we need our users to stay longer on our app.”
               </p>
               <p>
                Their formula was, More usage = More ad-views = More money.
               </p>
               <p>
                So Facebook trained an AI just for that purpose — to hook their users on their platform.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                the content we like, accounts we follow, amount of time we spend on a post, all these data have been fed to the AI. And the AI has evolved over time and got better at hooking us.
               </p>
               <p>
                The sole job of the AI is to hook us and show  ads.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                For instance, if you watch a comedy video, the AI will show you another comedy video. It notes down that you like comedies. And as it already knows how to hook people who like comedies, it will show you posts which it thinks you might like, with some ads in between.
               </p>
               <br>
               <hr>
               <br>
               <p>
                Coming back to me, the AI discovered that I like football, Barcelona to be specific. So it started recommending Barcelona’s videos on my feed and explore page, and I happily watched them. Over time, I got too obsessed with Barcelona. 
               </p>
               <p>
                At one point, I was checking Messi’s wife’s instagram profile, lol.
               </p>

               <br>

               <p>
                   <strong>So what?</strong>
               </p>

               <p>
                Because of all of this, you’re basically trapped in an <b>Echo Chamber</b>. You click a video of Barcelona. Then you’ll be served similar posts related to Barcelona, in Facebook, Instagram, Youtube… Your whole life would start to revolve around Barcelona.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                A few years ago, I was too concerned about climate change, plastic pollution, and global warming, to the point that it had affected my mental health. Just because my newsfeed on Instagram and Facebook were showing me pollution-related posts.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                For a human mind to grow, to learn, it needs multiple viewpoints and ideas. Limiting your mind’s exposure to a single topic can severely affect your mental health.
               </p>
               <br>
               <br>

               <p>
                   <strong>
                    Should I stop using Social media?
                   </strong>
               </p>
               <br>
               <p>
                Lol, no. I’m not saying that. I tried, didn’t work for me.
               </p>
               <p>
                Just be aware of this and make sure that you’re not in an “Echo Chamber.”
               </p>

                    Just a side-note, Facebook shows your crush’s or partner’s picture first in your newsfeed, just to get you hooked on their app. Hahahaha. Speaking from personal experience.
                </p>

                I’d recommend watching this Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma.
