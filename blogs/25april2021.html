                <p>
                    About two years ago, I came across this video of Jeff Bezos talking about his Regret Minimization Framework. He would project himself forward at age 80 and looking back in his life, he would then minimize the regrets he has. I found this concept─or framework─ really interesting.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I decided to incorporate it in my daily life. Whenever I have a decision to make, I’d ask myself, “Would I regret doing this or not doing this in the long term?” And if the answer was “not doing this”, I’d definitely do it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Going on my first hike, submitting my name for the Maths Competition, and recently, starting this blogsite are few of the decisions that I made using this framework. Had I not used the framework, I’d probably have not done any of those tasks out of fear. <br> There were few silly decisions like confessing to my crush (which didn’t turn out to be as expected), but still looking back, I don’t regret any of the decisions I made.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Now, this framework has been a main component of my decision making process. Whenever I come across something, I ask myself, “Would I regret doing this in the longer run?” and most of the time, the answer is no.
