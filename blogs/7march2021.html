                <p>
                    A couple months ago, I was returning home by a bus. I was sitting beside a girl, who was about my age and looked cute too. In my head I was thinking, <em>Okay, I have to talk to her! But what if she isn’t interested?</em> I glanced at her. She noticed. Shit, it’s awkward now.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <em>Come one Sulav, just start with a simple question. It’s now or never.</em>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “Ummm, which school do you go to?” I asked her with the deepest voice I could make, faking my confidence.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “St. Xavier’s school. And you?” She asked.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <em>Wait a minute! Is she interested in keeping up the conversation?</em>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “Well, I graduated from United Academy, but haven’t joined a college yet.”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “Oh really? Me too actually. I’m doing an internship these days, and searching for colleges as well. Have you decided which college you’ll be going to?” She asked me again. Woh!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “I’ve applied to a few US colleges and I’m waiting for the decisions to come out.”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “That’s great! I hope they’ll accept you.”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <em>At this point, I’m trying my best not to smile by faking a serious look on my face.</em>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “What’s your facebook id? I want to congratulate you after you get accepted.”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <em>No way. It’s not happening. Did she just ask me for my id? We haven’t even exchanged our names yet. Oooh!</em>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “I have deactivated my Facebook account, but I can give you my instagram id instead,” I replied.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “That would be even better,” she blushed. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We talked for a while until I had to get off the bus. But she DMed me on instagram later that night.
                </p>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    And that was a profound experience my fellas! A fucking boost for my confidence!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    She later revealed that she also wanted to talk to me before I had even started the conversation. This made me realize how many girls I could’ve talked to, only if I had built up the courage to start up a conversation.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The point is: <b>You never know what’s on the other side of the fear.</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Now for those of you who are wondering, “Is he really that shy around girls?”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Yes! 100% yes! Not just girls, but with boys too. The thing is, I’ve been an introverted boy since I was little. But, recently I’ve been working to fix that. 
                    <br>
                    The above was a Comfort Challenge, designed to push my comfort zone.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    What I’d ask you to do is, whenever you’re in public, try to talk to a person of opposite gender similar to your age, and ask for their number/id (Even if you don’t wanna be in a relationship with them, try this!). 
                    Worst case scenario? They’ll say no. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Even if you get rejected, who cares? There are lots of other fish in the sea baby!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <em>I'll share you a secret. I've talked to like 14/15 girls since that first one. 0 rejections.</em>
