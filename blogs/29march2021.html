                    <strong>Rick:</strong>  Oh-kay. So let’s talk about Podcasts now.
                </p><br>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Fred:</strong>  Sure.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Rick:</strong>  You’ve been telling me about Podcasts for quite a while now. Could you explain to our readers what exactly are podcasts and why you listen to them?
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Fred:</strong>  Podcasts are basically conversation between people, usually two. They are anywhere from 30 mins to 3 hours long. TV interviews usually focus on humor in the conversation, whereas podcasts focus on the depth of the conversation.
                    <br>
                    To answer your second question, I listen to podcasts for personal growth. There are podcasts which focus on entertainment or comedy. But for me, if it doesn’t add any value to my life or make me feel inspired, I find it a waste of time.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Rick:</strong>  Personal Growth. Hmmm. Can you expand on that?
                </p><br>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Fred:</strong>  Yeah sure. See, the podcasts I listen to are interviews of people who’ve reached to a certain height in their career, where they’re considered “successful” or “experts.” <br>
                Through the podcasts, they share the stories of their journey—the wins and the losses—through which we can take away valuable lessons. <br>
                They also share about what they think helped them to reach that height— their daily routines and habits. <br>
                One thing I found common among all successful people is that <em>they all are readers. They never stop learning. </em><br>
                Recently I finished listening to a podcast where Dr. Gabor Maté, a physician who specializes in neurology, psychiatry, and psychology. Although I didn't have prior knowledge or interest on psychology, after listening to this, I want to learn more about that. I highly recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/H9B5mYfBPlY" target="_blank">this</a> episode to everyone.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Rick:</strong>  I’d quickly add that to my list. Before we move on to another topic, lemme ask you this. How do you listen to podcasts and any favorite recommendations for our dear readers?
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Fred:</strong>  Well, I use Spotify to listen to podcasts. But you can use Google Podcasts app as well. YouTube is great too. <br>
                    <em>A pro tip: Listen to podcasts at 1.5x speed. A 2 hour long podcast in 80 minutes.</em><br>
