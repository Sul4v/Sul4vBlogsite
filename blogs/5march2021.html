                Kalinchowk Trip
            </div>

            <div class="writing-area">
                
                <p>It takes you Rs. 370, 5 hours, and a back pain to get to Charikot. And from there, you catch a jeep, pay Rs. 500, 2 hours, and an intense body ache to reach Kuri. You spend your night there, and wake up at around 5am to climb to Kalinchowk Mandir hill to see the beautiful sunrise and the magnificent mountain range. (There’s cable-car as well for those of you who don’t want to hike).</p>
                <br>

                <p>Kalinchowk. When you first hear this word, what comes to your mind? Temple or Hills? For me it was money. I had already spent all of my savings on my previous Baglung-Pokhara trip and a few camera gears. So when my didi asked me to go to Kalinchowk, I quickly checked my wallet. </p>
                <br>

                <p>“No amount of money ever bought a second of time,” a line from <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> always rings in my ear. So I never back down when it comes to making memories in exchange of money.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Rs. 3000 total. “I guess this should be enough for a 2-day trip, worst-case scenario: I would have to wash dishes in the same hotel where I’ll be staying” I thought. So, the next day, we travelled to Kuri Village and spent a night there. </p>
                <br>

                <p>The plan was to wake up at 4am, and hike for 1 hour to see the sunrise from the top. But I overslept. When I checked my phone at the middle of the night, it said 3:29. After 10 mins I checked again, it was 5:37. I quickly brushed my teeth, did whatever I had to do, and rushed towards the cable car station. If we were 10 minutes late, we would’ve missed the sunrise.</p>
                <br>

                <p>“Once you get to the top, you’ll stop reminiscing about the past and worrying about the future,” I overheard someone saying this. For some reason, it felt true. I stood at the edge of a cliff with my fists clenched. The hoodie and the jacket barely stood a chance against the cold wind. Like the jadoo from the movie <em>Koi Mil Gaya,</em> I yearned for the sunlight to hit my skin. </p>
                <br>

                <p>In a few minutes, the sun, which was hiding behind the mountains, showed its full face to dominate the blue sky. At that moment, not a single thought crossed my mind, but the appreciation for the mighty mountains standing in front of me. A whole mountain range could be seen from the place I stood. “I’m going to climb one of these one day,” I whispered. Down from the cliff were a few snow patches slowly starting to melt as the sun rays hit them.</p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    As I looked down at the Kuri village, I couldn’t stop thinking about the people living there. “Every single one of them depends on the people who come to visit Kalinchowk. Their whole year passes waiting for the visitors, selling goods and products brought from the main bazaar, and making a little profit. Is that all they want to do in their life?” I also thought about the driver who brought us to Kuri in his jeep, whose only job is to drive through that unpaved, rough road everyday, harming his body, just to earn some money. But in a way, I’m just like them. 
                    I fell down in the rabbit hole of all these thoughts, and it took me a while to snap out of it.
                </p> <br>

                <p>After spending a couple hours there, we returned back to our hotel. We searched for a jeep to get us back to Charikot, and started our journey back to home.</p>
                <br>

                <p>The thoughts that crossed my mind are still fresh in my head. All the questions that I ask to the people and to myself answers or adds perspective to a bigger question: What’s the purpose of my life?</p>
                <br>

                <p>I hadn’t expected it to end with this, but it’s fine I guess. Hahaha.</p>
