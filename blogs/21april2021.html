                    A parable worth sharing:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Once there was a spiritual guru. He lived in a hut deep down in a jungle with two of his disciples. One day he decided to test his disciples, so he called both of them in the middle of the night outside his hut.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    He handed both of them a lantern and said, “If you walk straight down this path for about 30 minutes, you’ll come across a well. Whoever first brings me a glass of water would receive a reward.”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    One of the disciples said, “It’s almost impossible. It’s so dark right now─I can’t even see the path. How are we supposed to go to the well with just a lantern?”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    While he was complaining, the other disciple moved slowly towards the well, holding his lantern in his hand. After a while, he returned back with a glass of water from the well.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When the disciple who was complaining asked him how he was able to go through the dark without seeing the whole path, he answered, “Yes, I couldn’t see the whole path, but I could see what was in front of me. And by taking one step forward at a time, I was able to walk all the way to the well and back.”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>The moral: You'll move forward once you start moving forward.</b>
                </p>
