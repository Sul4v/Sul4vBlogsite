                    “Baba, I was thinking, if we could open a 4-star hotel where only momos are sold, wouldn’t it be cool? If we do proper marketing, advertisements, and celebrity endorsements, we can make a fortune out of it!” I presented my business idea on the dinner table.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “Uhmm,” he replied.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    “We can create a brand, you know like that of the Himalayan Java, Pizza Hut or Nanglo, which specializes in one category and just doubles down on it. After a few years, we can open another hotel of the same brand in Pokhara, then Chitwan, then Biratnagar, and so on. Within a few years, woohoo, we’re freaking millionaires!” I couldn’t control my excitement.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We discussed the initial capital, the hiring process, the best location for the hotel, and even the brand name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My brother intervened, “It’s not that easy as it sounds. And also there are other problems like quality control, standard food taste, and so on.”
                    <br>“Yea. And that ‘few years’ that you’re talking about can easily turn into a decade or so,” mom added.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Conversations like these frequently sprout out on the dinner table of my house. The kitchen turns into a meeting hall: my dad’s a board member, I’m the CEO, and my mom and brother are partners. Roles change depending on the conversation but everyone gets to present their views.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The other day, I was explaining why we should all take vitamin and mineral supplements. A few weeks ago, we were talking about how quickly Dubai turned into a luxury-city. I remember, recently my dad was talking about how much potential a sausage factory has in Nepal. I later researched a bit and found that it would take 3.5cr just to buy a sausage-making-machine. (The idea didn’t move forward.)
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I love this!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Not talking about the business ideas. But the conversations. During this period of uncertainty and pandemic, I’m grateful for the fact that I get to spend quality time with my family and have fun conversations with them.

                <br>
                <p>
                    I know for sure when I’ll be 50-something, I’ll look back on my life and miss these moments with my mom and dad. So why not live these moments fully while I can?
