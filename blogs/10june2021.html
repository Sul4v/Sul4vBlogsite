                    Humans are the only animals that are aware of their existence in this world and that death is inevitable. So being a human, it’s my innate nature to think about life and death, after-life and before-life.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In 1954, the first human organ was transplanted from one human to another, and death was cheated. By the late 60s, liver, heart, and pancreas was successfully transplanted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only body organ that humans are unable to transplant is the brain, because of its overly-complex system. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I found it quite interesting, so I asked myself, “What if humans somehow found a way to transplant the brain too?” 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Let’s do a thought-experiment on John:
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first, let's cut off both of his hands and legs. He’d look miserable, but he’d still be alive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we'd transplant his liver, both of his kidneys, pancreas, stomach, lungs, … , and finally the heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If done successfully, he’d still be alive — maybe in a bad shape, but alive.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But his body has completely changed. His organs are not his, and the only part that’s left of him is his brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What this means is John is nothing but his brain. Nothing other than the brain.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If we could somehow transplant his brain to someone else’s body, he basically changed his body! Say, if a 60 years old man transplants his brain to a 15 years old boy, he basically reduces his age by 45 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is mind-boggling.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Some would say, “What about the soul? Does it also come with the brain?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don’t know.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This is just a theory, which obviously isn’t possible as of now. But if in the future, humans somehow cracks the code for brain-transplant, this is something that’s worth pondering on.
                </p>
