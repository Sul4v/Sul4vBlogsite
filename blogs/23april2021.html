                <p>
                    I had a blog post ready for today, but one of my friends asked me, “Why are you writing blogs? Do you really think people read them?”
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Oooh! I need to answer those questions first.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Lemme make this clear first: I HATE writing. Whenever I put pen to paper, my mind starts to wander off. I’d start imagining things totally off-related like, Newton sitting under an apple tree, or the price of the new iMac.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing leads to another, I’d find myself watching “Jethalal and Babita ji comedy scenes” on YouTube.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>So why to write?</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A couple months ago, I was listening to a podcast─you know, how much I like listening to podcasts─, and one of the two people said, “Writing is thinking on paper. To improve your thinking, improve your writing.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    This struck me. Later I realized the depth of that line. Writing is really thinking on paper.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Whenever we speak with someone, we say whatever comes on top of our head. We rarely do any filtering. But while writing, the filtering part of your brain is on steroids. Afterall you can’t just write whatever. The idea needs to flow logically, should be succinct, and feel interesting to the readers. And there are other things that also come into play, like word choice, grammar, number of words in a line and number of lines in a paragraph, and what to include and what to leave out.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Writing is not just thinking, but “hard-core” thinking on paper.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I wanted to improve my thinking. So I started writing. Writing about whatever I find interesting.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Blog was necessary?</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Just for you to lift a pen requires a lot of motivation, but I wanted to incorporate writing in my life as a habit.
                    One of the tricks to build a habit is to tell everyone. Also, money is a powerful motivator.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    That’s exactly what I did.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Whether people read my blogs or not, my primary goal is to improve my writing, and in turn thinking. But I always try to make my blogs educational or fun. I don’t want my readers to feel like they just wasted their time.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Thanks for sticking till the end. I really appreciate and love you for being with me in this writing journey!

                    P.S.: The above post is a 1st draft. I’m really amazed at how much my level of writing has improved within a month.
